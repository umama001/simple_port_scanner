A beginner-friendly Python script that scans a single TCP port on a given host.  
This project helps new learners understand basic networking, socket programming, and ethical hacking concepts.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Scans a **single TCP port**
- 🛑 Detects if port is **open** or **closed/filtered**
- 🔄 Handles invalid input and exceptions
- 📖 Easy-to-read Python code with comments

## 💻 How to Use

### 🔧 Run from terminal:

```bash
python3 port_scanner.py <target_host> <target_port>


Example:
